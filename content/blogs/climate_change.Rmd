To study climate change, we used data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference/base period which NASA clearly states should be the period between 1951-1980.

This analysis (given by Prof. Kostis) gave us:

```{r}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```
The two objectives in this section are to:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the weather dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment

2. Convert the dataframe from wide to ‘long’ format and to use the new dataframe, named tidyweather, to analyse the anomalies, assigned the variable delta.

```{r}
weather_update <- weather %>% 
  select(1:13)

head(weather_update)
```

```{r}
tidyweather <- weather_update %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, 
               names_to="Month", 
               values_to = "delta")
head(tidyweather)
```

Thus the dataframe now has three variables, for:

1. year,
2. month, and
3. delta, or temperature deviation.

##Plotting Information
To plot the data in a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline, we first need to create a new variable called date in order to ensure that the delta values are plotted chronologically.

```{r}
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap((vars(Month)))
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Month"
  )
```

Analysing this plot leads us to believe that the temperature increase is more pronounced in some months than others. Specifically, we see this when we look at these months: February, March, November and December. The graph depicts these months reaching into the 1.5-2 delta range which tells us that their temperatures were especially abnormal since most months come in at the 1-1.5 delta range.

To produce more useful plots, we will group the years into decades and filter out the decades prior to 1880.

```{r}
comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

head(comparison)
```
We can now employ this to create a density plot:

```{r}
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )
```

Continuing the analysis, we will look at annual anomalies in the data, using the following code:

```{r}
#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta= mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE )) 

head(average_annual_anomaly)
```

```{r}
#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         
```

NASA points out on their website that:

**"A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age."**

We will thus construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta from 2011:

```{r}
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
# choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_delta = median(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_delta = sd_delta/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            delta_low = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
            delta_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error)

  
formula_ci
```

The data is showing us that the average annual delta in temperature since 2011-present is 1.059609. We know this as we took the original dataframe and filtered for the interval between 2011-present. We then used the summarize function to get different statistics such as mean, median, etc.

We will analyze the TFL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:

```{r}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))
```

```{r}
# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

For both of the following graphs, we have calculated the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals, using the calculation excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals.

The mean should be used to calculate the expected rentals per month.

It is likely that the number of rentals on weekdays and weekends will vary by a lot , and the mean is able to take into account all values in the week. This gives a more accurate idea of the average number of rentals in the overall month. On the other hand, the median will only take the middle value in the data-set within the week. This is likely to be a weekday, since there are 5 weekdays in a week and 2 weekends. Median thus does not reflect the average rentals per month accurately.

```{r}
print.data.frame(head(bike))
```

```{r}
updated_bike <- bike %>% 
  filter (year >2015) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise (actual_mean_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

updated_bike_2016_2019 <- bike %>% 
  filter (year >2015 & year< 2020) %>% 
  group_by (month) %>% 
  summarise (expected_rental = mean(bikes_hired)) #expected rentals per month

final_bike <- left_join(updated_bike, updated_bike_2016_2019) %>% 
  mutate (excess_rentals= actual_mean_rental - expected_rental,
          up= ifelse(actual_mean_rental > expected_rental, actual_mean_rental, 
                     expected_rental),
          down= ifelse(actual_mean_rental < expected_rental, actual_mean_rental, 
                       expected_rental))

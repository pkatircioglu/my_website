<p>Using the relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020 we chose a smaller subset of the components and only listed the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food &amp; Beverages, Medical Care, Education and Communication, Recreation, and Apparel).</p>
<p>We see that from 2000 to 2021, yearly CPI change for “all items” is positive in most of the years.In contrast, yearly change of CPI in “apparel” category is negative in most of the years which indicates an overall price decrease year by year. The most volatile component of CPIin terms of price is “transport”, indicating a relatively higher year on year changes compared to other categories.</p>

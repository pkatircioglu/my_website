My name is Pinar Katircioglu. I am from Istanbul, Turkey. I have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering and Economics from Koc University. I am interested in Finance & Tech. Currently, I study MSc in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Prior to LBS, I had a 1-year experience at ACT Venture Partners, an early-stage deep-tech venture capital in Turkey. I plan to pursue my career in venture capital after LBS.

I have two sisters, one is 3 years older and the other is 11 years younger than me. Their names are Melis and Ada. I have a dog, Lola. She is a giant poodle and she is very cute. I love taking her to walk. My passion is horse-riding. I love horses and want to own one in the future. In my spare time, I like travelling, running, cycling and doing ceramics pottery.
